# AddValidationTypes - Redcap External Module

## What does it do?

This module allows you to add and remove custom validation types via the Control Center's "Field Validation Types" page, only to REDCap admins. The new validation types act just like all other native validation types; that means they are hard stops, work on data loads, and be disable (but still usable via a data dictionary upload).

## Installing

You can install the module from the REDCap EM repo or drop it directly in your modules folder (i.e. `redcap/modules/add_validation_types_v1.0.0`).
